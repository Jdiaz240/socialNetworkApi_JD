# socialNetworkApi_JD

Completed By Joshua Diaz

## Project Description:

In this assignment we were tasked with creating a social network api. Utilizing the tools we've learned recently such as routes, controllers, mongoDb, and mongoose I was able to create routes that would fulfill the CRUD requirements. Through Insomnia, users are able to create and delete users as well as connect users to eachother. Also each user would have the capability to post a 'thought' which would allow other users to post a 'reaction' to that 'thought' Users would also have the capability to delete anything preivously mentioned that was created.
